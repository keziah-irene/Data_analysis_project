This Data analytics project explores both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. For supervised learning, the car evaluation dataset was used to train K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest classifiers to predict car class. The Random Forest model with 100 trees achieved the highest test set accuracy of 91.9%. For unsupervised learning, the Boston housing price dataset was analyzed using K-Means, Agglomerative, and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to identify inherent data groupings, with visualizations provided through PCA. Logistic Regression was the top-performing model, achieving 94.2% accuracy in predicting car acceptability. The Boston Housing dataset shows distinct, inherent clusters. K-Means effectively partitioned the data, Agglomerative Clustering revealed a hierarchical structure, and DBSCAN successfully identified outliers.
